Sinatra Daemon

A service for starting and stopping Sinatra as a service on linux
boxen.


= Why?

Because I need to control Sinatra on a box that has
Apache+Rails+Mongrel, and I don't have access to thin, mod_passenger,
or rack to automagically start my Sinatra apps.


= TODO

* Actually add payloads (exec @app)
* Investigate daemon-kit
* Investigate Kernel.open vs. IO.popen vs. system vs. etc
